# Project Ideas

## Applications

### Online Speedcubing Platform

A hobby of mine is to collect and solve various rubiks cube inspired puzzles and I thought it would be fun to try and make an online platform where users can queue up in a competition with one another to see who can solve the fastest. It would have a leaderboard, ranks, etc.

### Rubiks Cube Scramble Visualizer

This idea was part of the Online Speedcubing Platform project where the intention was to be able to generate a visualization of a generated scramble so that players were confident that their solves were correct by comparing their cube to the visualization.

### Savings Progress Tracker

I'm currently using a spreadsheet to plan out how my savings should look in the future if I follow a savings plan and each month when I put in savings I color code the cell with either red, yellow or green depending on if I saved the full amount I wanted, a partial amount, or none at all. Kind of over complicating the idea with wanting a web app for this, but I thought it was a cool idea to kill time with.

## Tools

### Convert "px" to "rem" VScode Extension

When writing CSS, I find myself spending a lot of time pulling up a calculator to convert a pixel value to rem. It would be nice to make myself a tool that I could use in a way where I highlight the value, hit a keybind, and it converts to rem for me.

### Figma to CSS Design System Sync Script

At work I was working on a project and some team members mentioned an initiative to one day create a program that would automatically sync our current design system in Figma to our CSS stylesheets. I thought this would be a cool side project and still do, but Figma had to change their API to make variables a paid resource...

### Automatic Timesheet VScode Extension

I've been doing some freelance work and keeping track of time manually is simple but a chore at the same time. I'd like to have an extension where the time I am in a repository is automatically tracked so that I don't have to manually write down my start and stop times.
