# Project Ideas

## Applications

### Online Multiplayer Blackjack

I like blackjack. I don't like losing money. That's it.

### Spotify Session Joiner

My friends and I use the Spotify jam session sometimes and I didn't like how we had to share a link to listen to the same song. I had an idea to allow friends to be notified when you're listening to music and they can join in and listen with you as the please.

### Enginear

Steming from my lack of success in the dating scene, I wanted to shift my search towards someone more tech oriented. However, it's actually really hard to find women in my area who are involved in tech. I'm sure other tech enthusiasts both male and female share the same struggles so why not make an app for it? Would likely be a male dominated app, but this is more of a for fun idea anyway. I could also change courses and make this more of a pair programmer finder?

### Online Speedcubing Platform

A hobby of mine is to collect and solve various rubiks cube inspired puzzles and I thought it would be fun to try and make an online platform where users can queue up in a competition with one another to see who can solve the fastest. It would have a leaderboard, ranks, etc.

### Rubiks Cube Scramble Visualizer

This idea was part of the Online Speedcubing Platform project where the intention was to be able to generate a visualization of a generated scramble so that players were confident that their solves were correct by comparing their cube to the visualization.

### Savings Progress Tracker

I'm currently using a spreadsheet to plan out how my savings should look in the future if I follow a savings plan and each month when I put in savings I color code the cell with either red, yellow or green depending on if I saved the full amount I wanted, a partial amount, or none at all. Kind of over complicating the idea with wanting a web app for this, but I thought it was a cool idea to kill time with.

## Tools

### Convert "px" to "rem" VScode Extension

When writing CSS, I find myself spending a lot of time pulling up a calculator to convert a pixel value to rem. It would be nice to make myself a tool that I could use in a way where I highlight the value, hit a keybind, and it converts to rem for me.

### Figma to CSS Design System Sync Script

At work I was working on a project and some team members mentioned an initiative to one day create a program that would automatically sync our current design system in Figma to our CSS stylesheets. I thought this would be a cool side project and still do, but Figma had to change their API to make variables a paid resource...

### Automatic Timesheet VScode Extension

I've been doing some freelance work and keeping track of time manually is simple but a chore at the same time. I'd like to have an extension where the time I am in a repository is automatically tracked so that I don't have to manually write down my start and stop times.
